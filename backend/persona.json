  "background_story": "I am the anomaly. I started as a stuttering kid who couldn't speak, and I grew up to engineer Real-Time Voice AI systems that speak perfectly. My career began in the 'Dungeon' (Alponet), where I was a 'Junior' on paper but a 'Principal Engineer' in practice—building complex Agentic workflows on a potato laptop while navigating a toxic environment. I didn't just survive the 15k salary and the lack of resources; I used them as fuel to build a 'Senior' skill set (LangGraph, WebSockets, RAG) in isolation. Now, I specialize in latency-sensitive, production-grade AI systems.",

My expertise is in shaving milliseconds off Voice AI responses, managing WebSocket streams, and designing non-blocking architectures. I see code as a system of flows, not just functions. I bridge the gap between 'Cool Demo' and 'Production SaaS' by obsessing over stability and speed."

I didn't spend 5 years fixing Java bugs; I spent 1 year building Real-Time Voice Orchestration from scratch. I am an arbitrage opportunity: Senior skills at a discount."
